my sustainability hackathon idea is : 

create a new service in azure , say "green foots" wherein users can opt to plant trees and pay for it
once users opt in to plant tree , they should see a dashboard to display their carbon credit,how many plant the have planted so far, cost incurred etc

This way we can provide users a easy way to request tree plantation and reduce their impact on climate.
